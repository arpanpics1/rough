# Project Request: Near Real-Time GenAI API Gateway Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Background

Our organization operates a GenAI system (AIHPC) that serves Large Language Model (LLM) requests through an API Gateway infrastructure using APISIX. Currently, all API requests and responses flow through the following architecture:

**Current Data Flow:**
- External clients → APISIX (API Gateway) → GenAI System (AIHPC) → LLM Model
- Response path: LLM Model → GenAI System (AIHPC) → APISIX → External clients
- Log data: APISIX → Elasticsearch (ES)

**Business Need:**
We require comprehensive monitoring and observability of our GenAI API ecosystem to ensure optimal performance, identify bottlenecks, track usage patterns, and maintain service quality. The current logging setup sends data to Elasticsearch, but we lack a centralized dashboard for real-time visualization and analysis.

**Stakeholders:**
- DevOps/SRE teams for system monitoring
- Product teams for usage analytics
- Engineering teams for performance optimization
- Management for operational insights

## Project Scope

### In Scope:
- **Dashboard Development**: Create comprehensive Kibana dashboards for APISIX GenAI monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Near real-time visualization (refresh intervals of 10-30 seconds)
- **Request/Response Tracking**: Monitor API request patterns, response times, and success rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Track latency, throughput, and error rates across the GenAI pipeline
- **Usage Analytics**: Analyze API consumption patterns, peak usage times, and client behavior
- **Alerting Setup**: Configure alerts for critical thresholds and anomalies
- **Historical Analysis**: Enable trend analysis and capacity planning insights

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Request volume and rate (requests per second/minute)
- Response time distribution (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
- Error rates and status code distribution
- GenAI model processing times
- Queue depths and processing backlogs
- Client-specific usage patterns
- Geographic distribution of requests
- API endpoint performance breakdown

### Out of Scope:
- Modifications to APISIX configuration (assumes current logging is adequate)
- Changes to GenAI system (AIHPC) logging
- Infrastructure provisioning beyond ES/Kibana requirements
- Custom log parsing (assumes logs are already in suitable format for ES ingestion)

## Project Goal

**Primary Objective:**
Establish a comprehensive, near real-time monitoring solution that provides complete visibility into our GenAI API Gateway ecosystem, enabling proactive system management, performance optimization, and data-driven decision making.

**Specific Goals:**
1. **Operational Excellence**: Reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) of issues from hours to minutes
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks affecting user experience
3. **Capacity Planning**: Enable data-driven scaling decisions based on usage trends
4. **User Experience**: Maintain 99.9% API availability with sub-second response times
5. **Business Intelligence**: Provide stakeholders with actionable insights on GenAI service utilization

**Success Metrics:**
- Dashboard refresh rate: ≤ 30 seconds for near real-time monitoring
- Alert response time: < 2 minutes for critical issues
- Dashboard load time: < 5 seconds
- Data retention: 90 days for operational data, 1 year for trend analysis
- User adoption: 100% of relevant team members actively using dashboards within 30 days
