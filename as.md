As an enterprise system, we need to synchronize unique identifiers across multiple systems (CRM, ERP, Data Warehouse, etc.) to ensure data consistency, prevent duplicate records, and maintain proper relationships between entities. This includes implementing comprehensive database constraints to enforce data integrity rules across all tables and systems.
Success Criteria

All systems use consistent unique identifiers
Zero duplicate records across systems
99.9% data synchronization accuracy
Real-time or near-real-time sync capability
Comprehensive database constraints implemented
Audit trail for all ID changes
Rollback capability for failed synchronizations
