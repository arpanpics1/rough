Need to create EPIC on the below, can you help me in expanding the details


Here I am looking to extend my framework to create a remediantion Module for the non compliant data. Can you suggest me on this.
Here I am looking to first let use show if a records is non compliant from past days then for this record, we should not generate a new incident. And can you give suggest some more idea for remediation module
Current Framework Overview:
Users define rules via a UI, applying them to tables or columns.
Multiple rules can be applied to a single column or different columns in the same table.
Rules are consolidated into a single SQL query, executed using PySpark to identify compliant and non-compliant records.
Non-compliant records are stored in a separate location for further analysis.
I want to extend this framework

Objective:

Enhance the data quality framework by introducing a remediation module for non-compliant data. This module will identify recurring non-compliant records, prevent duplicate incident generation, and provide advanced remediation workflows.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Identification of Recurring Non-Compliant Records: Ensure that recurring non-compliant records do not trigger new incidents unnecessarily.
Implement a unique identifier mechanism for records to track their compliance history.
Develop logic to compare current non-compliant records with historical data.
Flag recurring records and suppress duplicate incident generation.


2. Remediation Status Dashboard: Offer a centralized view of remediation activities.
Design a dashboard to display key metrics such as total non-compliant records, resolved incidents, and pending tasks.
Allow filtering and sorting based on severity, table, column, or rule.
Include visualizations like trend charts and pie charts to track remediation progress.

3. Additional Ideas for Remediation Module require further groom and discussion
