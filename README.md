Big shoutout to Dinesh for all the awesome work he’s done in getting the observability platform up and running for Malts. Syncing the APISIX logs into the SDP system—especially within such a short timeline—was no small task, and he handled it like a pro.

Thanks for pulling all the pieces together, coordinating with everyone, and keeping things moving smoothly. Really appreciate your quick thinking, humble attitude, and the way you always step up when needed.

Great work, Dinesh—thank you for making this happen! 🙌




A big thanks to Anshul for all his hard work and support in getting the observability platform ready. His efforts in moving data from HDFS to the Kafka topic were a huge part of making things work end-to-end.

Really appreciate how he coordinated with everyone involved and made sure the data side of things was sorted out smoothly. His willingness to jump in, stay patient, and keep things on track made a big difference to the overall delivery.

Thanks a ton, Anshul, for your dedication and teamwork—you helped make this whole thing come together! 🙌
