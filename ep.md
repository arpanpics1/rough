# EPIC: API6 Log Streaming, Processing, and Reconciliation Platform

## Epic Description

Implement a comprehensive data streaming and processing platform that captures API6 logs, streams them through Kafka, processes and validates data across multiple storage systems (SDP Hive tables and Elasticsearch), and performs end-of-day reconciliation to ensure data consistency and integrity across all systems.

## Business Value

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enable real-time log analysis and alerting through Kibana dashboards
- **Data Quality**: Ensure data integrity through schema validation and segregation of valid/invalid records
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails and data consistency across multiple systems
- **Operational Excellence**: Provide comprehensive visibility into API6 performance and issues

## Technical Design Details

### Architecture Overview

```
API6 Applications → Kafka Topic → [Schema Validation] → Parallel Processing
                                                      ├─→ SDP Hive Tables

                                    ↓
                              Reconciliation Service
```

  - Partitions: 12 (based on expected throughput)
  - Replication Factor: 3
  - Retention: 7 days
  - Compression: gzip

#### 2. Schema Management
- **Schema Registry**: Confluent Schema Registry

### Data Flow Details

#### Message Schema (Avro)
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "API6Log",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "timestamp", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "request_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "api_endpoint", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "http_method", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "status_code", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "response_time_ms", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "client_ip", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "user_agent", "type": ["null", "string"]},
    {"name": "payload_size", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "error_message", "type": ["null", "string"]}
  ]
}
```

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Log Ingestion**: API6 applications send logs to Kafka using async producers
2. **Schema Validation**: Kafka Connect validates messages against Avro schema
3. **Parallel Processing**: 
   - Spark Streaming job processes Kafka messages for SDP
   - Logstash/Kafka Connect processes messages for Elasticsearch
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid records routed to respective error tables/indices
5. **Monitoring**: Metrics collected at each stage for observability

### Error Handling Strategy

#### Validation Errors
- **Schema Validation**: Messages failing schema validation are sent to dead letter queues
- **Business Logic Validation**: Custom validation rules applied post-schema validation
- **Error Enrichment**: Validation errors include original message, error type, and timestamp

#### System Failures
- **Kafka Producer**: Retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern
- **Processing Jobs**: Checkpoint-based recovery, idempotent processing
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling with health checks

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Key Metrics
- Kafka producer/consumer lag
- Schema validation success/failure rates
- SDP ingestion rates and errors
- Elasticsearch indexing rates and cluster health
- Reconciliation discrepancy counts

#### Alert Thresholds
- Kafka consumer lag > 100,000 messages
- Schema validation failure rate > 2%
- Elasticsearch cluster health = red
- Reconciliation discrepancy > 1%
